# Rearranging-the-Deck-Chairs
Supporting Models and Write-ups for the project 'Rearranging the Deck Chairs on the Titanic'

Note that the model files are in .mdl format, which can be viewed using Vensim. There is a free viewer provided by Ventana Systems available at https://vensim.com/vensim-model-reader/

Additionally, the model files can be directly opened in any text editor and the model equations viewed directly. The mdl format is inteded to be human-readable, though  Vensim or similar dynamic modeling software (such as Stella) is needed to generate dynamic behavior from these files.
