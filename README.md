# Rearranging the Deck Chairs on the Titanic
Supporting Models and Write-ups for the project 'Rearranging the Deck Chairs on the Titanic: A Simulation Model Of Behavioral Resource Utilization Under Crisis'

The 'Presentations' folder has PowerPoints and posters that describes this project at a higher summary level.

The 'Papers' folder has current and former revisions of the manuscript.

Note that the model files are in .mdl format, which can be viewed using Vensim. There is a free viewer provided by Ventana Systems available at https://vensim.com/vensim-model-reader/

Additionally, the model files can be directly opened in any text editor and the model equations viewed directly. The mdl format is inteded to be human-readable, though  Vensim or similar dynamic modeling software (such as Stella) is needed to generate dynamic behavior from these files.
