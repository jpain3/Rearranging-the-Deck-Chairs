# Rearranging the Deck Chairs on the Titanic
Supporting Models and Write-ups for the project 'Rearranging the Deck Chairs on the Titanic: A Simulation Model Of Behavioral Resource Utilization Under Crisis'

The 'Presentations' folder has a PowerPoint that describes this project in more detail, along with posters presented at the 2022 Informs Annual Meeting that summarize the model and results.

The most current summary of the project as a slideshow can be found in the 'Presentations' folder as well, and is linked here [linked here](https://github.com/jpain3/Rearranging-the-Deck-Chairs/blob/main/Presentations/PDF/RearrangingTheDeckChairs_Paine_Summary_V1_INFORMS_2022.pdf "Latest Presentation")

Note that the model files are in .mdl format, which can be viewed using Vensim. There is a free viewer provided by Ventana Systems available at https://vensim.com/vensim-model-reader/

Additionally, the model files can be directly opened in any text editor and the model equations viewed directly. The mdl format is inteded to be human-readable, though  Vensim or similar dynamic modeling software (such as Stella) is needed to generate dynamic behavior from these files.
